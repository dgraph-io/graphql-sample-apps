### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To-Do is a sample app that lets users manage the tasks on their personal to-do list. This app demonstrates how to use React hooks with an Apollo client to easily create, read, update, and delete to-do list items. Deploying this app on Slash GraphQL deploys both the back-end database service and a front-end React app in a single click, no credit card required. To learn more about this sample app, see: [Building a To-Do List React App with Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/blog/post/building-todo-list-react-dgraph/)
