Pokedex is a sample app inspired by the [Pokedex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/) website. This sample app lets users search for Pokemon by type, weakness, ability, and more! This app demonstrates how to filter Pokemon by tags and update a captured status. Deploying this app on Slash GraphQL deploys both the back-end database service and a front-end React app in a single click, no credit card required. To learn more, see [Pokedex on GitHub](https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-sample-apps/tree/master/pokedex).
